# Madlib-Genrator
As we all know how we have fun playing Mad Libs as kids, So I created this Mad Libs Generator. My purpose for making this was I had a long break with python programming so to brush up I made this as this is a very entry-level project for beginners. If you had a long break with Python programming  you should try this project to brush up some basic concepts like Tkinter, functions , strings variables
